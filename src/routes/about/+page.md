Jason (he/they) is a content creator, academic, interdisciplinary filmmaker and writer striving for queer and trans liberation through a decolonial lens. This goal is based on LGBTQ studies, filmmaking, writing, queer literature, Jewish studies, and a bit of psychology. He is a storyteller and a "story-capturer," where he envisions a new world, and captures moments within this world that celebrate LGBTQ people. They are committed to queering the Digital Media Industry, the “Poetry/Literary World,” and, more ambitiously, the world at large. 

Jason also occasionally publishes his writing on substack [here](https://queerjewfagrambles.substack.com/) and runs a small [YouTube channel,](https://www.youtube.com/@faginnyc) where he is known as “faginnyc.” They share fashion and styling advice while documenting his life when he previously lived in Brooklyn. Jason hopes to make it back to the city.
